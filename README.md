# StarWarsApp
This app displays a list of characters from Star Wars, using the SWAPI (https://swapi.dev/). You can click on each character to display further details about them.

Focus:
- implementing base architecture and MVP functionality
- making the UI accessible (screen readers, keyboard access, dark mode, font scaling)

Not yet implemented / future plans:
- implement pagination - currently only one page is shown
- store the data locally to avoid repeated network calls
- add option to mark characters as 'Favourite' and view a list of your favourites
- improved UI in general and in landscape orientation
